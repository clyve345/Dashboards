# Dashboards

Welcome to the "Dashboards" repository, where I share Power BI dashboards created out of my interest in various topics. These dashboards are not necessarily linked to specific coding projects but are inspired by diverse themes and areas of interest.

## Project Description

This repository is a collection of Power BI dashboards that I've created to explore and visualize data on different subjects. The dashboards are developed independently of my other projects, focusing solely on the interest and insights of particular topics.

## Dashboard List

Currently, the repository includes the following dashboard:
- **Data Analytics for Display Advertisement Campaign**: This dashboard provides insights into the effectiveness of display advertising campaigns, analyzing key metrics to gauge performance and outcomes.

### Future Dashboards

Additional dashboards will be added to this repository as they are developed. These future dashboards will further explore various datasets and will be linked to a PostgreSQL database for enhanced data management and visualization.

## Technologies and Data Sources

Currently, all dashboards are created exclusively with Power BI. Future enhancements will include integration with PostgreSQL databases to manage and visualize the data more effectively.

## Installation and Usage Instructions

To use the dashboards:
1. Clone this repository or download the files directly from GitHub.
2. Ensure you download any associated images used within the dashboards for buttons, filters, and backgrounds to maintain the intended visual layout and functionality.

## Contributing
Currently, this project is not open for contributions. However, feel free to explore the dashbaords and use them as a reference for your dashboard projects.
